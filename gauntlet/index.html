            <p>The Gauntlet is a challenge within multiple Pokemon games, made up and executed by TheGravyNator. The essence of the challenge is to use pokemon from older generations (in my case Gen 3 and Gen 4 respectively), challenge every Elite Four in subsequent games (and challenge Red on Mt. Silver) while transferring them up to the modern Pokemon games.</p>
